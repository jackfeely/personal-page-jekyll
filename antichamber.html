  <p>Antichamber is a game that gives you an awesome number of opportunities to 'break' the game. That is, the game enables you to break the 'rules' that it has crafted around you. And incredibly, the game does this without telling you (this is crucial)--it doesn't even teach you fish, it just hands you a rod and leaves the rest to you. This is empowerment in videogames. Give the player an inch to bend the rules, and see what happens. And Antichamber recreates these conditions over and over.<p>

  <p>The first example of this 'show don't tell' gameplay comes after you've acquired a gun that can at first only pick up and shoot two small cubes (there's nothing in the game to kill). Shoot one of your cubes into a cube sized box to open the door in front of you. Shoot the second cube to open the second door. Now you come to a third door, but you're out of cubes, and you can't retrieve your first two cubes without going back through the doors you opened. But you go back and pick up the last cube you fired, however at this moment the door you opened with that cube quickly closes in front of you. This is where hopelessness sets in. Clever players will soon discover though that you can prevent the door from shutting by blocking it with a cube. So: open door 1 with cube 1; walk under door 1 and shoot cube 2 so that it is resting (these cubes don't obey the laws of physics) underneath door 1; go back and retrieve cube 1 and voila: door 1 stays up; finally go to door 2, retrieve the cube that's holding up door 1, causing it drop, but that's okay because now you have both cubes and you're at door 2; rinse and repeat.</p>
