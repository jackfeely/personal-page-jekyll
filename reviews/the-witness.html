  <p>The Witness is a game about epiphany. You begin the game in darkness, in a physical sense--the game opens with you standing in a dark tunnel, before you slowly emerge to find a sun soaked uninhabited island--and mentally: everytime you start a new set of puzzles, you have very few clues as to how to solve them. But try a puzzle a few times and you manage to solve it, maybe by accident, it doesn't matter. You move to the next, solve it. A pattern begins to emerge; neurons start firing in new places of the brain. Now you've learned one of the game's many rules--a rule learned early on is that black and white tiles must be separated by the line you draw from the start of the panel to the finish--and you won't stop till you've learned all of them.</p>
