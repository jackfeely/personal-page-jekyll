  <p>A website similar to this one is <a href="http://www.actionbutton.net/?page_id=175">ActionButtonDotNet</a>. I like the simple layout--it's just a list of videogame reviews. A nice touch is the user's ability to change the color of the background, so the default is black, but if you don't like that color you can change it to white, or purple, or a few other more complex backgrounds. Also you can sort the reviews by date or name--another example of giving the user a small degree of control over their site experience.</p>

  <p>Looking at the source code, there is only one section that I can decipher, and that is the list of all the reviews (each unordered list item links to a different page containing that review). I'm going to guess that <!--<link rel='stylesheet' id='stick-admin-bar-to-bottom-css'--> has something to do with the admin bar that always scrolls with the page.</p>
